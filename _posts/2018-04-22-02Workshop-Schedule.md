R and Spatial Data

This workshop provides an introduction to working with spatial data in R and doing exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA).  Examples of ESDA methods include lagged scatter plots, Moran scatter plots, and linked micromaps.  We will briefly mention some R packages that have been specifically developed to meet the needs of monitoring and modeling aquatic resources, such as lakes, rivers, and streams.  Lastly, we will show how R and ArcGIS software can be integrated.  The objective of this workshop is to provide users with the fundamentals of reading, visualizing and analyzing spatial data in R.
