title: "Lesson 4 - Spatial Data in R - Interactive Mapping"
author: Marc Weber

There are a number of packages available now in R for mapping and in particular interactive mapping and visualization of spatial data - we'll take a quick look at a few here. Note that for this section, images on web page here are not interactive (long story....has to do with limitations to the way this GitHub blog site is rendered) - your results, except for using initial ggplot figure, will be interactive.



## Lesson Goals
- Explore a sampling of interactive mapping libraries in R

## Quick Links to Exercises
- [Exercise 1](#exercise-1): ggplot and plotly
- [Exercise 2](#exercise-2): mapview
- [Exercise 3](#exercise-3): leaflet
- [Exercise 4](#exercise-4): tmap
- [R Mapping Resources](#R-Mapping-Resources)

## Exercise 1
### ggplot and plotly

This first set of examples include gplot and ggmap, which aren't interactive, but shows using plotly with ggplot map for interactive map
```r
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(mapview)
library(tmap)
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(USAboundaries)
library(rbokeh)
states <- us_states()
states <- states %>%
  dplyr::filter(!name %in% c('Alaska','Hawaii', 'Puerto Rico')) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(perc_water = log10((awater)/(awater + aland)) *100)

states <- st_transform(states, 5070)
# plot, ggplot
g = ggplot(states) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = perc_water)) +
  scale_fill_distiller("perc_water",palette = "Spectral", direction = 1) +
  ggtitle("Percent Water by State")
g
```

Use plotly to make interactive
```r
ggplotly(g)
```

## Exercise 2
### mapview
`mapview` is a nice package that makes use of `leaflet` package but simplifies mapping functions.  Here again we'll use the states data pulled in with the USAboundaries package. 

```r
mapview(states, zcol = 'perc_water', alpha.regions = 0.2, burst = 'name')
```
![mapview](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/mapview.png)

Spend some time playing with parameters in mapview - examine the interactive plot - try different backgrounds, see how you can toggle individual features on and off.  `mapview` can plot rasters as well - try generating a simple map like the one above using one of the raster layers from the raster section.  After you plot a raster, see if you can plot multiple layers - `mapview` makes it easy to plot multiple layers together as described [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview/blob/develop/vignettes/articles/mapview_02-advanced.Rmd)


## Exercise 3
### leaflet
`Leaflet` is an extremely popular open-source javascript library for interactive web mapping, and the `leaflet` R package allows R users to create `Leaflet` maps from R. Note that `mapview` is using `Leaflet` under the hood and simplifies the mapping process.

The simplest of leaflet maps
```r
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-123.290698, lat=44.565578, popup="Here's where I work")
m  # Print the map
```
![leaflet](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/leaflet.png)

You can add vector (point, line, and polygon) and raster data to leaflet maps.  Add our states polygons. Note that you need to set the CRS for states to WGS84 or NAD83 to plot in `leaflet` as well as transform from `sf` to `sp` object - below we do all that in chained dplyr steps.
```r
state_map <- states %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326) %>%
  as("Spatial") %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons()
```
![leaflet_states](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/leaflet.png)

Your turn - try adding worldclim raster data using `raster` `getData` function to a leaflet map and explore other provider tiles, and try if you want setting some diffrent tiles to make a simple interactive map. Note that some of the providers do require an API key.

## Exercise 4
### tmap
`tmap` is an R package designed for creating thematic maps and based on the layered grammar of graphics approach Hadley Wickham uses with `ggplot2`.  It has a lot of really fantastic functionality - we'll just touch on very simple examples with datasets we've used so far but I'd encourage exploring this package further.

```r
# just fill
tm_shape(states) + tm_fill()
# borders
tm_shape(states) + tm_borders()
# borders and fill
tm_shape(states) + tm_borders() + tm_fill()
tm_shape(states) + tm_borders() + tm_fill(col='perc_water')
```
![tmap](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/tmap.png)

You can save a map object and then use layering similar to ggplot2
```r
map_states <- tm_shape(states) + tm_borders()
map_states + tm_shape(wsa_plains) + tm_dots()
```
