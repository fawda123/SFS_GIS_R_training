The `sf` Simple Features for R package by Edzer Pebesma is a new, very nice package that represents a changes of gears from the `sp` S4 or new style class representation of spatial data in R, and instead provides [simple features access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) for R. Without a doubt, `sf` will replace `sp` as the fundamental spatial model in R for vector data - packages are already being updated around `sf`, and it fits in with the "tidy" approach to data of Hadley Wickham's `tidyverse`.  The simple feature model will be familiar to folks who use [PostGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS), [MySQL Spatial Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), [Oracle Spatial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Spatial_and_Graph), the [OGR component of the GDAL library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL), [GeoJSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7946/) and [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) in Python.  Simple features are represented with Well-Known text - [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) - and well-known binary formats.

The big difference is the use of S3 classes in R rather than the S4, or new style classes of `sp` with the use of slots.  Simple features are simply `data.frame` objects that have a geometry list-column.  `sf` interfaces with [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos) for topolgoical operations, uses [GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL) for data creation as well as very speedy I/O along with [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos), and also which is quite nice can directly read and write to spatial databases such as [PostGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS). Additionally, as mentioned above, `sf` fits into the `tidyverse` design, and the list-column for geometry are officially considered a `tidy` data form.  See Edzer Pebesma's [Spatial Data in R: New Directions post](https://edzer.github.io/UseR2017/#tidyverse-list-columns) for the description of `tidy` aspects of `sf`.

Edzar Pebesma has extensive documentation, blog posts and vignettes available for `sf` here:
[Simple Features for R](https://github.com/edzer/sfr).  Additionally, see Edzar's [r-spatial blog](http://r-spatial.org/) which has numerous announcements, discussion pieces and tutorials on spatial work in R focused.

## Exercise 1
### Getting to Know `sf`
To begin exploring, let's read in some spatial data. We'll grab EPA Wadeable Streams Assessment sites to begin looking at.

```r
library(RCurl)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
download <- getURL("https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-10/wsa_siteinfo_ts_final.csv")

wsa <- read.csv(text = download)
class(wsa)
```

Just a data frame that includes location and other identifying information about river and stream sampled sites from 2000 to 2004.

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

Before we go any further, let's subset our data to just the US plains ecoregions using the 'ECOWSA9' variable in the wsa dataset.

```r
levels(wsa$ECOWSA9)
wsa_plains <- wsa[wsa$ECOWSA9 %in% c("TPL","NPL","SPL"),]
```

Because this dataframe has coordinate information, we can then promotote it to an `sf` spatial object.

```r
wsa_plains = st_as_sf(wsa_plains, coords = c("LON_DD", "LAT_DD"), crs = 4269,agr = "constant")
str(wsa_plains)
```

Note that this is now still a dataframe but with an additional geometry column. `sf` objects are still a data frame, but have an additional list-column for geometry. 

What is different about an `sf` dataframe, and what is code below doing?

```r
head(wsa_plains[,c(1,60)])
```

```

##18 IAW02344-0098   POINT(-91.92294 42.70254)
```

We can do simple plotting just as with `sp` spatial objects. `sf` by default creates a multi-panel lattice plot much like the `sp` package `spplot` function - either plot particular columns in multiple plots or specify the `geometry` column to make a single simple plot.  Note how it's easy to use graticules as a parameter for `plot` in `sf`. 

```r
plot(wsa_plains[c(46,56)], graticule = st_crs(wsa_plains), axes=TRUE)
```

![WSASites](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/WSASites.png)

Try some of these variations and see if they make sense to you.

```r
plot(wsa_plains[c(38,46)],graticule = st_crs(wsa_plains), axes=TRUE)
plot(wsa_plains['geometry'], main='Keeping things simple',graticule = st_crs(wsa_plains), axes=TRUE)
```

And `ggplot2` now supports directly plotting `sf` features using `sf_geom`:

```r
ggplot(wsa_plains) +
  geom_sf() +
  ggtitle("EPA WSA Sites in the Plains Ecoregions") +
  theme_bw()
```

![WSASites_ggplot](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/WSASites_ggplot.png)

## Exercise 2
### Spatial operations - spatial subsetting and intersecting
Now let's grab some administrative boundary data, for instance US states.  After bringing in, let's examine the coordinate system and compare with the coordinate system of the WSA data we already have loaded.  Remember, in `sf`, as with `sp`, we need to have data in the same CRS in order to do any kind of spatial operations involving both datasets.

```r
library(sf)
library(USAboundaries)
states  <- us_states()
levels(as.factor(states$state_abbr))
states <- states[!states$state_abbr %in% c('AK','PR','HI'),]

st_crs(states)
st_crs(wsa_plains)
# They're not equal, which we verify with:
st_crs(states) == st_crs(wsa_plains)
# We'll tranfsorm the WSA sites to same CRS as states
wsa_plains <- st_transform(wsa_plains, st_crs(states))

# Now we can plot together in base R
plot(states$geometry, axes=TRUE)
plot(wsa_plains$geometry, col='blue',add=TRUE)
```

![States_WSASites.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/States_WSASites.png)


Spatial subsetting is an essential spatial task and can be performed just like attribute subsetting in `sf`.  Say we want to pull out just the states that intersect our 'wsa_plains' sites that we've subset via an attribute query - it's as simple as:

```r
plains_states <- states[wsa_plains,]
```

There are actually several ways to achieve the same thing - here's another:

```r
plains_states <- states[wsa_plains,op = st_intersects]
```

And we can do another attribute subset and then apply a spatial subset yet another way - verify this works for you by plotting results together

```r
iowa = states[states$state_abbr=='IA',]
iowa_sites <- st_intersection(wsa_plains, iowa)
```

It's worth spending some time with the topological operations in `sf`.  `st_intersection` as used above returns an `sf` data frame of the `wsa_plains` sites that intersect the `iowa` polygon.  `st_intersects` on the other hand returns either a list or matrix of true / false values - for instance: 

```r
sel_list <- st_intersects(wsa_plains, iowa)
```

This first selection returns a list with a positive (1) value where there is an intersection and empty result where no intersection

This second selection below returns a matrix of true / false values for intersections and can be used for subsetting the original data

```r
sel_mat <- st_intersects(wsa_plains, iowa, sparse = FALSE)
iowa_sites <- wsa_plains[sel_mat,]
plot(plains_states$geometry, axes=T)
plot(iowa_sites, add=T, col='blue')
```

![Iowa_sites.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/Iowa_sites.png)

What about all our sites that are not in Iowa?

```r
sel_mat <- st_disjoint(wsa_plains, iowa, sparse = FALSE)
not_iowa_sites <- wsa_plains[sel_mat,]
plot(plains_states$geometry, axes=T)
plot(not_iowa_sites, add=T, col='red')
```

![Not_Iowa_sites.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/Not_Iowa_sites.png)

## Exercise 3
### Spatial operations - joins
Spatial joining in R is an incredibly handy thing and is simple with `st_joins`. By default `st_joins` will perform an left join by default and use st_intersect by default as well for the spatial topological operation.  Note that you can also do an inner join as well as use other topological operations for the join such as `st_touches`, `st_disjoint`, `st_equals`, etc.

For this simple example, we'll strip out the state and most other attributes from our WSA sites we've been using, and then use the states `sf` file in a spatial join to get state for each site spatially.  This is a typical task many of us frequently need - to assign attribute information from some spatial unit for points within the unit.

```r
# Use column indexing to subset just a couple attribute columns - need to keep geometry column!
wsa_plains <- wsa_plains[c(1:4,60)]
wsa_plains <- st_join(wsa_plains, plains_states)
# verify your results
head(wsa_plains)
```

```
Let's dive a little deeper with spatial joins and bring in some water quality data using the [dataRetrieval](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval) package to access data via web services on the [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/). Steps shown here follow examples in the [tutorial](http://usgs-r.github.io/dataRetrieval).
 
First we'll load the `dataRetrieval` library and pull down some nitrogen data for Iowa to play with.  Note how we pull out siteInfo below - this is a data table attribute of distinct sites in the IowaNitrogen object pulled down - explore the object a bit (using `str` or `class` or other means).

```r
library(dataRetrieval)
IowaNitrogen<- readWQPdata(statecode='IA', characteristicName="Nitrogen")
head(IowaNitrogen)
names(IowaNitrogen)

siteInfo <- attr(IowaNitrogen, "siteInfo") 
unique(IowaNitrogen$ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode)
```

Next we need to take this raw data and do some filtering and summarizing to get data we can use for mapping and joining with the WSA data we've been using so far. Spend a little time and see if you can follow what we're doing below - notice the way the dplyr functions are being called here - why might that be needed as oppossed to typical way of calling functions?

```r
IowaSummary <- IowaNitrogen %>%
  dplyr::filter(ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode %in% c("mg/l","mg/l      ")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(MonitoringLocationIdentifier) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(count=n(),
            start=min(ActivityStartDateTime),
            end=max(ActivityStartDateTime),
            mean = mean(ResultMeasureValue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-count) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(siteInfo, by = "MonitoringLocationIdentifier")
```

Now we just need to make the data spatial - we have coordinates so it's as simple as:

```r
iowa_wq = st_as_sf(IowaSummary, coords = c("dec_lon_va", "dec_lat_va"), crs = 4269,agr = "constant")
```

Let's plot it with our other data and see what we've got - tip for subsetting while plotting is from [rpubs here]( https://rpubs.com/cyclemumner/sf-plotting).

```r
plot(st_geometry(subset(states, state_abbr == 'IA')), axes=T)
plot(st_geometry(subset(wsa_plains, STATE =='IA')), add=T, col='blue')
plot(iowa_wq, add=T, col='red')
```

![Iowa_WQ_sites.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/Iowa_WQ_sites.png)

Now let's try to join this water quality nitrogen data in a given proximity to WSA sampled sites. We'll first need to transform the data to a projected coordinate system since we'll be using distance in our join this time.  `sf` can make use of both `proj4` strings and epsg codes - to find the epsg code for UTM zone 15 in Iowa which we're using here just search on [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/). Note our projection is in meters so we set our distance very high - obviously we wouldn't join water quality sites tens to hundreds of kilometers away to other sites using euclidean distance for a real application - this is just for illustrative purposes to show how we can do distance based joins in `sf`.

```r
wsa_iowa <- subset(wsa_plains, state_abbr=='IA')
wsa_iowa <- st_transform(wsa_iowa, crs=26915)
iowa_wq <- st_transform(iowa_wq, crs=26915)

wsa_wq = st_join(wsa_iowa, iowa_wq, st_is_within_distance, dist = 50000)
```

You'll see if you do `head` on your data there are a LOT of fields in there now - what we're interested in is the mean field we calcluated earlier in `dplyr` steps that gives us mean nitrogren concentration at water quality sites.

## Exercise 4
### Spatial operations - aggregation

Now that we've joined water quality data based on proximity to our WSA sample sites, we can aggregate the results for each WSA site.  What happened in the previous spatial join step we performed was that we generated a new record for every water quality site within the proximity we gave to our WSA sites - check the number of records in the wsa_iowa data versus the number of records in our join result - we haved repeated records for unique WSA sites.  So let's aggregate results using dplyr - see if you can figure out how on your own!

For performing spatial aggregation, the idea is to take some spatial data, and summarize that data in relation to another spatial grouping variable (think city populations averaged by state).  Using some of the data we've used in previous steps, we can accomplish this in a couple of ways.

Let's grab some chemistry data for the WSA sites we've been using so far:

```r
download <- getURL("https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-10/waterchemistry.csv")

wsa_chem <- read.csv(text = download)
wsa$COND <- wsa_chem$COND[match(wsa$SITE_ID, wsa_chem$SITE_ID)]
```

Let's join the chemistry data to WSA sites - we're going to summarize the data by states, so let's also plot all the WSA sites with states to look at

```r
wsa = st_as_sf(wsa, coords = c("LON_DD", "LAT_DD"), crs = 4269,agr = "constant")
states <- st_transform(states, st_crs(wsa))
plot(states$geometry, axes=TRUE)
plot(wsa$geometry, add=TRUE)
```

![States_WSA.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/States_WSA.png)

Now we'll roll together join and dplyr group-by and summarize to get a conducivity per state object which we'll map using ggplot and geom_sf
```r
avg_cond_state <- st_join(states, wsa) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(name) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(MeanCond = mean(COND, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(avg_cond_state) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = MeanCond)) +
  scale_fill_distiller("Conductivity", palette = "Greens") +
  ggtitle("Averge Conductivity (uS/cm @ 25 C) per State") +
  theme_bw()
```

![State_Cond.png](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/State_Cond.png)

Your turn - try summarizing some other data and do perhaps a different summarization method, or change palette in ggplot, etc.

## Reading in Spatial Data with `sf`<a name="reading-in-Spatial-Data-sf"></a>
We showed earlier how to read in both shapefiles and geodatabase features using sp - let's do the same with `sf`. To see what vector data formats you can read / write with `sf`, type:

```r
st_drivers()
```

Again, lots and lots of options!  Here are a couple quick examples for both shapefile and geodatabase features using `st_read` in `sf` (replace my example file paths with file paths to use to working directory on your computer:

Reading in shapefiles:
```r
download.file("http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip", "ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip")
unzip("ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip", exdir = ".") 
countries <- st_read("ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp") 
plot(countries$geometry) # plot it!
```

![countries](/AWRA_GIS_R_Workshop/figure/countries.png)

Reading in geodatabases - we'll just recycle geodatabase we use in the `sp` session:
```r
# Geodatabase Example - if you haven't already downloaded:
download.file("https://www.blm.gov/or/gis/files/web_corp/state_county_boundary.zip","/home/marc/state_county_boundary.zip")
unzip("state_county_boundary.zip", exdir = "/home/marc")
fgdb = "state_county_boundary.gdb"

# List all feature classes in a file geodatabase
st_layers(fgdb)
```

```r
##  layer_name     geometry_type features fields
##1 state_poly     Multi Polygon     2825      4
##2   cob_poly     Multi Polygon       75      5
##3    cob_arc Multi Line String      399      8
```
```r
# Read the feature class
state_poly = st_read(dsn=fgdb,layer="state_poly")
state_poly$SHAPE
```
